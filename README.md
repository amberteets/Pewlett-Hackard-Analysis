# Pewlett Hackard Analysis
## Retirement Planning

## Background & Purpose

Pewlett Hackard is anticipating a surge in employee retirement as its "Baby Boomer" workforce reaches retirement age. In order to properly handle this workforce shift, the company is looking to offer retirement packages or opportunities to participate in a mentorship program for employees who meet certain criteria, as well as identify positions that will need to be filled in the near future. To those ends, Pewlett Hackard ordered an analysis of its workforce data to determine how many and what kinds of employees will be retiring.

## Results

- If all eligible employees choose to retire, a substantial number of senior-level positions will need to be filled including
  - 29,414 Senior Engineers
  - 28,254 Senior Staff
- In addition to senior positions, many mid-level engineers and staff are eligible for retirement, potentially leaving large capability gaps within the organization
  - 14,222 Engineers are eligible for retirement
  - 12,243 Staff are eligible for retirement
- Only 2 members of management are retiring, leaving the Pewlett Hackard leadership largely intact

## Implications

Pewlett Hackard has a large number of employees who are eligible for retirement; **90,398 roles** will need to be filled. Fortunately, there are many employees - **1,549 in total** - within each department that qualify as mentors for the next generation of workers. The following table shows the number of retirement-eligible and mentorship-eligible employees in each department.

Departments with fewer eligible mentors (Research, Quality Management, Finance, etc.) may have difficulty training the next generation of employees if there is a low rate of participation in the mentorship program.
